# Chooser - Android application
Chooser's main goal is to serve as a decision helper for the user.<br>
The methodology is to use the other usersâ€™ opinions in order to help the decision maker, or, in other words, help people make daily choices using the wisdom of crowds.<br>
The app was designed to help someone who needs to make a decision and choose between two choices.<br>
For example, a user trying to decide between two pairs of shoes in a shoe store, can simply upload a post that includes pictures of these two pairs using Chooser, and let other users help him decide which shoes to buy!<br>
Users can also use the app just to get the crowd's opinion and settle scores with their friends.<br>
For example: iOS or Android? Walking Dead or Game of Thrones?, Playstation or Xbox?, Coffee or Tea? etc...<br>
Chooser uses your facebook account in order to log-in.<br>
Chooser also provides statistics about the votes to get a better understanding of their post's results.<br>
